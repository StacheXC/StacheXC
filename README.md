I am Brett Pedersen, and I am a student studying Data Science at Brigham Young University. I have worked on several projects and labs, which can be found in my repositories. I am proficient in the R and Python programming languages, having a knowledge of many of the data science packages used with them. I also have experience with several other data science tools, such as sql and tableau.
